## Two tracks for software tech writers:
- Focused on the technical side (writing developer documentation for APIs, distributed systems, and cloud infrastructure, creating and testing code snippets in languages like JavaScript, JSON, or Python, explaining software architecture, working within a docs-as-code framework, being a SME for areas of a product)
- Focused on the project management side (managing documentation projects, creating content strategies, developing product documentation based on user stories, giving user feedback on UX, knowledge of PM methodologies and tools, being a SME for areas of a product)

## What I did during a short career break
- House reno
    - The biggest project--and why I took the break at all--was to help finish a house remodel we started at the end of 2021. Our house is midcentury and the basement was remodeled by the homeowner sometime in the 70s or 80s. It wasn't up to code and there were some major 
- Progressive postcards
- Focused on hobbies
    - Knitting (worked on complex projects, worked on improv project, put time into documenting projects and taking notes)
    - Watched a lot of movies
    - Got back into reading. I went through a period of burnout after finishing my English degree. Reading hundreds of pages a week, I learned to skim and skip through to important passages. I read to piece out the thesis of each paragraph or chapter, then highlight the supporting evidence and summarize what I would discuss in class. I did this with everything I read, whether peer reviewed articles, 18th century literature, technical textbooks, essays, or literary fiction. It's a great strategy to consume vast quantities of text. But it's tiring in a way that takes the fun out of reading. I took almost two years off to recover from the burnout of forcing myself to speed read at all times of day.

    Now that I had time and mental space, it was easy to pick up reading for fun. My aim was to return to being someone who reads, but not necessarily become a "Reader." I'm okay with reading slowly; I love to savor and re-read beautiful prose. I also don't judge myself for reading "lowbrow" fiction--pretensiousness is boring!

    While I couldn't help myself from making a 2023 reading goal, it's modest enough that I can take time off from reading and not fall behind. It feels great to be reading again.

- Just exist.
    - I started working and going to college right out of high school. I worked multiple jobs at the same time to pay for school and optimized my class schedule, so most semesters I was starting classes at 7am and ending a shift at 10pm. Every summer, I worked full-time and even before I graduated, I started working a full-time job. I graduated during covid, making life extra stressful. My second job out of college was at a fast-paced startup that expected individual employees to do the work of a full team. I've never known what it's like to just exist. 

    Just existing does have a stress of its own--especially for people like me who need to be productive at all times. And life didn't slow down for me, since my days were filled with making major house decisions, doing and learning every trade we could, and managing contractors coming in and out of the house. The stress of finances also crept back in. But not having a thousand responsibilities on top of all of that--being able to take time during the day to just exist, to sit with my thoughts, and allow myself to do nothing for an hour--changed my life. 

-  
- Taking a break between jobs is a huge privilege, and honestly it's one I never thought I could experience. Especially not so early on. It wasn't part of the plan. And it was scary--so scary that I had an anxiety attack before deciding to do it, convinced that I wasn't deserving enough, that I would waste it, that I would lose my value as a person by not having the identity of my job. But those reasons are why this was invaluable for me as a human being. Though I lost what I had as a PersonWithATechJob™️, I found so much about who I am outside of that. It's certainly not as outwardly impressive or marketable. But at the end of the day, you have yourself, and everything in life is much more enjoyable when you know what you like, what your values are, and how to just exist as yourself.
