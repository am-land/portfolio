In the fall of 2022, I decided to leave my Technical Writer job without another job lined up. I had never done that before and I only entertained the idea because:

> 1. I was dealing with intense sustained overwork, with more being added to my plate. 
> 2. My company was acquired and I was the only one left on my team, dealing with fundamental job and benefit changes and an eventual layoff date.
> 3. I was able to save enough for MCOL expenses to make it financially doable (with a set end date).

Taking a break between jobs is a huge privilege, and honestly it's one I never thought I could experience. Especially not within the first 10 years. It wasn't part of the plan. And I was scared&mdash;so scared that I had an anxiety attack before deciding to do it, convinced that I wasn't deserving enough, that I would waste it, that I would lose my value as a person by not having the identity of my job. But those reasons are why this was invaluable for me as a human being. Though I lost what I had as a PersonWithATechJob™️, I found so much about who I am outside of that. 

It's certainly not as outwardly impressive or marketable. But at the end of the day, you have yourself to live with; and everything in life is much more enjoyable when you know what you like, what your values are, and how to just exist as yourself.

Here are some things I did during my break.

--------------------------------------

### Renovated my house

The biggest project&mdash;and the main reason for the break&mdash;was to help finish a house remodel we started at the end of 2021. Our house is mid-century and the basement was remodeled by the former homeowner sometime in the 80s. There were some major changes we wanted to make: re-build the floor plan (no structural changes), add a primary bedroom with en-suite bathroom and closet, move the furnace and water heater out of the basement, and bring everything up to code. I've been the unofficial project manager while my partner has acted as the general contractor. 

To keep to our budget, we've done a lot of the work ourselves and hired out what we couldn't do. I've helped with many of the projects, but my partner has done most of the work, from researching, to planning, to executing.

We recently finished the primary shower, which was the last major project we wanted to get done before the summer. Though there's still a ton to do, we're at a good pausing point to get started on some major work on our yard. After spending over a year in the basement, we're excited for a change of pace working on the exterior.

### Volunteered to get out the vote
I knew I wanted to volunteer in some way, even though I wasn't in a good place to commit a lot of resources. I decided to sign up for [Postcards to Swing States](https://www.turnoutpac.org/postcards/), an initiative by the Progressive Turnout Project. 

Through them, you can select which swing state you want to send postcards to. You choose how many postcards you can commit to, buy the postcards and stamps, hand write a message, and mail the cards by a cutoff date.

I chose to send out 100 postcards because it seemed achievable while still being impactful. It was a great experience and I'd love to do it again!

--------------------------------------

### Focused on hobbies

**I'm a lifelong knitter, so I took this time to knit complex projects**. I designed my own sweaters, then wrote and graded patterns just for fun. I put time into documenting projects and taking notes on my experience with different yarns, construction methods, and techniques.

**Watched a lot of movies.**  During the pandemic, I came to appreciate film more than I ever have. For the past few years, I've set a goal of watching 52 movies and have either watched more or gotten close every year. The films I find the most compelling usually fall into these categories: psychological thriller, contemplative, neo-Western, cerebral, science fiction, and surreal horror. 

**Got back into reading.** I went through a period of reading burnout after finishing my English degree. Reading hundreds of pages a week, I learned to skim and skip through to important passages. I read to piece out the thesis of each paragraph or chapter, then highlight the supporting evidence and summarize what I would discuss in class. I did this with everything I read, whether peer reviewed articles, 18th century literature, technical textbooks, essays, or literary fiction. It's a great strategy to consume vast quantities of text to discuss in an academic setting. But it's tiring in a way that takes the fun out of reading. I took almost two years off to recover from the burnout of forcing myself to speed-read at all times of day.

Now that I had time and mental space, it was easier to pick up reading for fun. My aim was to return to being "someone who reads," but not necessarily become a "Reader." I'm okay with reading slowly; I love to savor and re-read beautiful prose. I also don't judge myself for reading "lowbrow" fiction&mdash;pretensiousness is boring!

While I couldn't help myself from making a 2023 reading goal, it's modest enough that I can take time off from reading and not fall behind. It feels great to be reading again.

**Learned to spin fiber.** This has been a long-term goal and it's been so much fun. I took a drop-spindle class, then taught myself to spin on the 3D printed [Dreaming Robots EEW Nano 2 eSpinner](https://www.dreamingrobots.com/product/eew-nano/). Just recently, I leveled up to the [EEW 6.0](https://www.dreamingrobots.com/eew-60/).

So far, I've only spun with combed top, but I'd love to try minimally-processed local fiber that requires more prep and skill.

--------------------------------------------

### Managed "life admin"

**Scheduled appointments and ran errands during the day.** This was one of the best things about not working when most other people are. I could knock out tasks in several hours, when they would normally take most of a Saturday.

**Cooked labor-intensive meals.** Anything that required a lot of prep or needed to cook all day&mdash;beef stew or dough with a kneading schedule&mdash;was easy enough to plan into my day. Given that my partner worked full time *and* worked on the reno most evenings, I was happy to take on most of the meal planning, grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning, and other house projects that linger when life is busy. 

**Took care of the small things.** All those random small tasks that don't really fit into a category&mdash;those tasks that occupy more time in your brain than they'd take to just get them done (but then you'd have to do them). You know what I'm talking about.

**Just existed.** I started working and going to college right out of high school. I optimized my class schedule so I could work multiple tech support jobs at the same time while paying for school. Most semesters, I started class at 7am and ended a shift at 10pm. Every summer I worked full-time, and even before I graduated, I started working a full-time tech writing job. I graduated during covid, making life extra stressful. My second job out of college was at a fast-paced startup that relied on one employee to do the work of a full team. Honestly, I've never experienced what it's like to just exist.

 Just existing does have a stress of its own&mdash;especially if you have an internal pressure to be productive at all times. And life didn't slow down for me, since my days were filled with making major house decisions, doing and learning every trade we could, and managing contractors coming in and out of the house. The stress of finances also crept back in. 
 
 But not having a thousand responsibilities on top of all of that&mdash;being able to take time during the day to just exist, to sit with my thoughts, and allow myself to do nothing for an hour&mdash;changed the way I think about my life.

--------------------------------------------

## My return to work
Almost five months to the day of my last job, I began job hunting. Six months was my cutoff period, and the timing coincided with some expensive house projects we had planned. While nothing had really calmed down in our lives, I started to feel two things:
1. The capability&mdash;and desire&mdash;to contribute to a team, plan and track my tasks, and get back to technical writing. 
2. The financial strain of living off savings. I was extremely motivated to make an income again.

But despite it being a good time personally to jump back in, the tech job market has remained ice cold after the layoffs. Overall, it took me about a month of job hunting full-time, but based on other market discourse I've seen, I got lucky. Again, I had the luxury of time. Applying for jobs this time around was immeasurably easier than when I've job hunted while working. 

I split my job hunting into three phases:

**Phase 1 - Pre-applying:** Polishing my resume, updating my portfolio, cleaning up my site, reading a ton of job hunting advice relevant to tech writing, updating LinkedIn, letting my references know I was job hunting, telling my network I was open to work.

**Phase 2 - Applying:** Navigating what job boards I liked the most, tailoring my resume/cover letter (this took the most time), filling out job applications, writing answers to the role-specific questions on applications, attending local tech writing networking events, responding to emails and calls, scheduling interviews.

**Phase 3 - Interviewing:** Writing and reviewing all of my general interview notes (preparation is the only way I make it through interviews), practicing my 60-second pitch, practicing my answers to common questions, researching companies and hiring panels, listening to job advice podcasts, reading an interview prep book, bookmarking my tailored materials for easy access during interviews, keeping my office background clean, figuring out my tech setup, testing all the video conferencing tools with my devices (seriously, I made so many tweaks to each one before interviewing). 

I had a spreadsheet with every relevant data point in order to keep track of what companies I applied to, what platform I applied on, who I talked to, any important deadlines, and what stage of the process I was in. I also kept a database of all job descriptions, since those are helpful when studying for interviews but sometimes get pulled down before companies start interviewing.

Another thing that helped is that towards the end of my previous job, I pushed through the burnout to update my resume while it was fresh. That meant I had reflected on it for months before being able spend a couple weeks focused only on improving it, rather than starting from scratch.

--------------------------------------------

## Closing thoughts
Even though I was able to pull from savings to keep contributing, leaving a job with no backup plan is a huge risk and I'm extremely grateful that my partner was supportive through everything. More than that, he was the one who encouraged me to do it when my mental health tanked, and talked me down when I kept saying "what the hell did I just do?!" I'm lucky to have an amazing partner and I will absolutely return the favor if he ever decides to take a big career risk like I did.

At the risk of sounding solipsistic, I think often about where I'm at in my life, where I've come from, and where I want to go. Though I'd like it if each of these were three separate, orderly stages, I can't ignore that the most genuine part of me sees these stages as non-linear. They all exist as I do. They will always play a part in my current situation, influencing my decisions, self perception, and thought patterns.

If there's one takeaway from this, it's that I never thought of myself as someone who would&mdash;or ever could&mdash;not work for a time. I was resigned to my own personal hedonic adaptation, believing that one day&mdash;in retirement&mdash;I would have enough control over my life to live as I wanted. While I've now settled back into a work routine that allows me to also focus on who I am outside of work, having time away from work gave me a deeper understanding of myself. Life is more than work... it goes on even when there isn't work; and there are so many parts of life that aren't defined by work at all.
