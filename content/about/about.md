I'm a technical writer in the software industry. I'm passionate about good [user-centered documentation](https://idratherbewriting.com/category-user-centered-documentation/).

-----------------------------------------------------

### I like to work on:
- How-to guides and tutorials
- Information architecture
- Style guides and templates
- Writing in markup languages like Markdown and AsciiDoc

-----------------------------------------------------

### I'm interested in:
- [Docs-as-code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/)
- API documentation
- [Topic-based authoring](https://everypageispageone.com/the-book/)
- [reStructuredText (reST)](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html)

-----------------------------------------------------

### I use these methodologies and guidelines:

- [DiÃ¡taxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/)
- [GitLab's Documentation Guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/)
- [Google's developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style/)
- [GOV.UK Design System's UI components](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/)
- [Testing your instructions](https://idratherbewriting.com/2015/07/07/testing-your-instructions/)
- [Write the Docs Documentation Principles](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/docs-principles/)

### My career path:
- **August 2015 to graduation** - I studied as an English, Tech Comm major full time while working my way up through various part-time student positions: 
    - IT Help Desk Specialist 
    - Technical Support for my university's Degree Tracker tool
    - Production Support in Web Development
    - Software Review Analyst in Project Management
- **December 2019** - I was eager to gain more experience, so before I graduated, I got a job as a Technical Writer for my state's Transportation Department. I took evening classes so I could work full time.
- **May 2020** - I graduated with a BA in English, Writing, Rhetoric, and Technical Communication, and a certificate in Technical Communication. Spring 2020 was a difficult time to graduate; I was grateful I already had a job!
- **June 2021 to present** - I realized I wanted to be a technical writer in software, so I started at a California-based startup that develops AI software for structuring data.

> **Why tech writing?**  
> I've always had an interest in both technology and communication. I created websites for my friends as a kid and English was my favorite class. When I realized as a college freshman that I could pursue both interests, I thought it was too good to be true! Technical writing is the perfect career for me and every day I'm excited to learn new technology (and document it!).

-----------------------------------------------------

### When I'm not working, I like:

- **Knitting sweaters**. I also like writing patterns and recently began learning how to [grade knitwear](https://www.jillwolcottknits.com/techniques/grading/) (yay spreadsheets!).
- **Cooking** new recipes. I recently made some delicious [Chicken Katsu](https://www.seriouseats.com/tonkatsu-chicken-pork-katsu-japanese-breaded-cutlets-recipe).
- **Gardening** with my partner. We're growing our first garden this year with several varieties of tomatoes, onions, peppers, peas, and some catnip for our two adorable cats.
- **Gaming**. [Celeste](http://www.celestegame.com/) and [Spiritfarer](https://thunderlotusgames.com/spiritfarer/) are two of my favorites. I also recently became absorbed in the trading card game Magic: The Gathering.
