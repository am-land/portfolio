title: "The Site You're on Right Now"


---

I created this site using the static site generator Hugo. 

## Context
I wanted a website to host my portfolio and blog. To start, I created a [list of requirements]({{< ref "how-i-created-my-hugo-site.md#my-site-requirements" >}}) for my site so I could make an informed decision on how to create the site. Based on those requirements, I decided to build a site via a static site generator (SSG). Between [Jekyll and Hugo]({{< ref "how-i-created-my-hugo-site.md#jekyll-vs-hugo" >}}), I chose Hugo.

> **Site details**
> - Static site generator: [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), written in Go
> - Hugo theme: [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) by @[adityatelange](https://github.com/adityatelange)
> - Hosted on: [GitHub](https://github.com/am-land/portfolio)
> - Deployed via: [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

From start the finish, building my site took me **about a week of evenings**. This included learning the tools, learning how Hugo works, keeping a [process log]({{< ref "how-i-created-my-hugo-site.md#what-i-did-to-facilitate-learning" >}}), and customizing my theme. 

## Tools
Here's what I used to work on this project:
- Git and GitHub
- Langauges: HTML, CSS, Markdown
- Terminals: Git Bash, Windows PowerShell, Command Prompt
- Visual Studio Code
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (static site generator)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

I wrote a detailed guide on the process: [How I Created My Hugo Site]({{< ref "how-i-created-my-hugo-site.md" >}}). This guide is a step-by-step tutorial for beginners, but it also gives you insight into how I figured things out and made decisions.
