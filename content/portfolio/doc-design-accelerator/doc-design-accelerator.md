**Project:** Create a detailed feature guide to introduce and document a new plugin.

**Context:** Ephesoft developed a collection of new features that fundamentally altered the way administrators use the product. One of those features was a plugin called Document Design Accelerator. This plugin simplified the batch class creation process by using AI to extract rules automatically. 

Transactâ€™s documentation is formal. The primary audiences are developers and system administrators.
