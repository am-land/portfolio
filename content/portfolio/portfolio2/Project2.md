## Context
I created this documentation request template as a way to gather information about requests or sprint tasks from Engineering and Product teams. When I was hired at my current company, we captured little information about documentation tasks and spent a lot of time following up on simple requests. This often lead to incorrect estimation, over-promising, and wasted hours working toward an unexamined goal.



## Outcome
