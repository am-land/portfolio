[Ephesoft](https://ephesoft.com/) is an intelligent document processing (IDP) startup based out of Irvine, CA. I work as a Technical Writer on a small team (currently just me), leading our major release documentation and all of our writing projects. I write and maintain feature guides, tutorials, how-to articles, reference guides, system administrator documentation, and knowledge base articles.

Here’s a highlight list of documentation I’ve written for Ephesoft’s two products.
